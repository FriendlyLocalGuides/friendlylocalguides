            <h6>The Vernisage</h6>
            <p>
                at Izmailovo is a large, outdoor shopping market, full of all sorts of Russian souvenirs, crafts, and
                other interesting things to buy. At this "flea market," you can browse through paintings, rugs from
                central Asia, and even stop for a bite to eat or drink, where you can taste dishes from different
                regions of Russia and other former-Soviet nations.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h6>The Kremlin</h6>
            <p>
                Adjacent to the Vernissage is the Kremlin at Ismailovo. The kremlin, or kreml in Russian, means
                "fortress," so there are kremlins in many of Russia’s cities, not only the most famous one on Red Square.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our Izmailovo tour is a unique opportunity to be submerged into an atmosphere that resembles the past
                and to see the masters of handicraft at work, such as blacksmiths, potters, and woodcarvers.
                If interested, you can even participate in the production itself!
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h6>The Tsars’ palaces</h6>
            <p>
                at Izmailovo were built based on drafts and engravings from the 16th and 17th centuries.
                The white stone towers are decorated with colored tiles in accordance with ancient traditions.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h6>Souvenirs</h6>
            <p>
                This flea market is a beautiful spot, brimming with boutique stores and majestic houses.
                Before returning back, treat yourself to a traditional drink – tea or vodka – with homemade
                pastry and snacks. Make sure you take a peek in the
                Chocolate Shop – you simply won’t be able to resist the temptation!
            </p>
            <p>
                Most shops are open only on weekends, until about 5:00pm. Working hours are not always
                predictable as some stay open longer and others shut down earlier. It is an unforgettable adventure
                in Izmailovo but you need to catch the magic in time before the shops close.
