        Only in Moscow for a short time and want to get the most out of the city and have fun? Then a
        3-hour bike tour is what you need! You won’t hear much about Russian history or become an expert
        on Russian art, but you will experience all the rest of Russian culture! This tour gives you a
        <strong>unique perspective</strong> of <strong>a little bit of everything</strong> in 3 or 5 hours:
        <strong>must-see tourist sights, local hangouts, Russian food, a glimpse of the modern Moscow life, amazing
            photo opportunities, a bit of Russian history, and a lot of fun!</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a great opportunity to cut the usual all day tour down to only 3 or 5 hours and get the
        most out of the city while having <strong>fun</strong> and being <strong>fit</strong> in the greatest
        locations around Moscow!
