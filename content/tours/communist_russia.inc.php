<h5>Itinerary:</h5>
<div class="intro-txt">
    <p>
        Mother Russia has undergone a lot in its long life. Since time immemorial, Russian rulers have taken
        nearly all political power into their own hands. By the beginning of the XX century, the Russian
        oppositional movement wanted nothing less than the immediate and total destruction of the tsarist
        regime. All of Russia got involved in the bloody revolution of 1917 in an effort to abolish the current
        state of the government and gain freedom for the people.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Our mission on the tour is to find out:</strong></li>
        <li>- How much this 1917 revolution cost the people</li>
        <li>- Whether they actually got the freedom they wanted and was it worth it</li>
        <li>- What happened over the next 74 years</li>
        <li>- Who were the main political leaders of the Soviet Union</li>
        <li>- Were Russians happy and satisfied with Soviet Union?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Our itinerary will lie in most Soviet areas of Moscow, which are quite spread throughout the city, as
        very few of them are left. You can choose how much you are ready to live this Soviet life on a 3, 5,
        or 7 hour tour. Depending on the duration of the tour, you will see part or all of the places below:
    </p>
</div>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h6>Red Square</h6>
        <p>
            Time stands still in Red Square. The Red Square is the heart of Moscow (and whole Russia).
            Saint Basil's Cathedral will make your mouth drop. If it is from May-October, have a cocktail on
            the outside terrace and simply people watch! The massive square offers so much to enjoy.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h6>Lenin’s Mausoleum</h6>
        <p>
            The burial place of one of the most influential leaders in the world.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h6>Revolution Square Metro Station</h6>
        <p>
            Rub the Soviet dog’s nose for good luck and admire the 76 bronze sculptures, devoted to the
            passionate, strong-willed and patriotic Soviet people.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h6>Museum of Contemporary History</h6>
        <p>
            The highest points in Moscow (172 meters), where Napoleon waited for keys of Moscow in vain.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h6>Museum of the Great Patriotic War </h6>
        <p>
            We’ll have a glance at Russian life of the XX century in the
            <strong>Museum of Contemporary History</strong>,which houses bits of everything from Russian
            history of XXth century: from English club to a
            storage of Stalin’s presents.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h6>All-Russian Exhibition Center (VVC)</h6>
        <p>
            with its giant arch, amazing fountain, and huge pavilions of different Soviet Republics.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h6>Bunker 42</h6>
        <p>
            Highly recommended <strong>Bunker-42</strong>, <strong>Cold War Museum</strong>, explore the place
            where Khrushchev lived during the Cuban Crisis. Go down 18 floors to a gigantic bunker under Moscow
            that was designed to withstand a nuclear attack. Watch a short film about the severity of the
            Cold War. If you lived through the Cold War, you will hardly believe it is possible that you are
            in Bunker 42!
        </p>
        <h6>OR</h6>
        <p>
            Wander through <strong>Sparrow Hills</strong> and climb up to the highest observation deck of
            Moscow with stunning views of all seven Stalin’s skyscrapers, including
            <strong>Moscow State University</strong>. After that, experience the excitement of taking a
            <strong>river cruise</strong> on river Moscow and catch the views of the Kremlin and Soviet times.
