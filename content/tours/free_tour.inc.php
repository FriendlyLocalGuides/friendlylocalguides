                    <img class="rating" src="/i/stars/stars-5.png" alt=""/>Alina is an excelent companion. She's extremely fun, flexible and versatile and knows Moscow like the back
                    of her hand. She'll take you to every interesting and fun place you want to know in Moscow from the great
                    Museums, War Memorials and Cathedrals that represent Russia's splendour, to wonderful restaurants, cafes and
                    places where you can just chill out and enjoy your surroundings as if you were a muscovite all with a great
                    schedule flexibility. I spent over 10 days with her as my guide and I got to see so many facets of Moscow
                    the existence of which I wouldn't have even fathomed hadn't it been for Aina's company.
                    She'll make you feel like home and will guarantee that your visit is amazing!

                    <img class="rating" src="/i/stars/stars-5.png" alt=""/>Monika is young and energetic and wealth of
                    information. She is personable and it was a pleasure having her show us some of the highlights of
                    her city. I would highly recommend Alina if you are visiting Moscow and need a local tour guide.

                    and we had a great time visiting the Kremlin & Red Square with her. We just wished we had more time
                    to visit the inside of the Kremlin and the Armoury. I would definitely recommend her. She is very
                    pleasant to visit Moscow with, she has quite a lot of knowledge. Thanks Nastya!

                    <img class="rating" src="/i/stars/stars-5.png" alt=""/>My guide was very knowledgeable and gave me
                    very interesting facts about the places we were seeing,the city and the culture. We ate at local
                    cafes (good local food and prices). I could never have been able to manage the metro without her.
                    The tours were at a very relaxed pace but we saw a lot in our time together. I really enjoyed our
                    conversations and our days together. She made me feel comfortable in the areas we toured and I went
                    back on my own when not on tour. I highly recommend this guide and tour
