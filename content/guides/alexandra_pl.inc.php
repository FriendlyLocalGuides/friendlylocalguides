            <li>I’m in love with music. Especially, jazz. It gives me the shivers, when I hear swing rhythm.</li>
            <li>When I was younger I wanted to become an actress and moved to Hollywood. I’m serious! That is the reason, why I’ve started to learn English deeply.</li>
            <li>I had been learning Spanish for 10 years and last year I’ve started to learn French. I’m aficionado of Romanic languages. Also, I’m crazy about Scandinavian culture and I’m going to learn at least one of its language soon.</li>
            <li>I’m 100% northern.</li>
            <li>I love Eastern ethnic food which we have here, in Russia, and I know a lot of places where you can get it, so if you want to try a really good shawerma, I know where you should go.</li>
            <li>I drag my ukulele all over the place.</li>
            <li>I’m so, so passionate about Russian culture, especially literature and language itself! I always try to share it with somebody who doesn't acquainted with it. Yet.</li>
            <li>I have a labrador whose name is Hulk. Yeah, it’s Hulk.</li>
            <li>I’m kind of a dreamy person. I have to dream about something to live on.</li>
            <li>I was named after a heroine of famous Russian movie ‘Moscow does not believe in tears’. If you haven’t seen it, do it. It’s got an Oscar, by the way.</li>
