<!--        <h3>Wine Lover</h3>-->
        <ol>
            <li>I am a passionate traveler. I grab every opportunity to go to the airport;  I love to stay by locals that's why I say NO to all-inclusive.</li>
            <li>I love yoga. This is not just a weekly training, it's my style. It's the way a spend every day of my entire life.</li>
            <li>Recently I have turned my dream into reality. I wrote a song and lyrics and recorded it.</li>
            <li>Every winter I go to mountains for skiing. Next year Iâ€™m going to do it again and being honest it is still a challenge for me.</li>
            <li>I jumped with a parachute. It was almost three years ago but still I consider this experience to be one of the best in my life.</li>
            <li>I'm a coffee addict.  I always look for a new brand of coffee.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing in life is the sea. I adore it!! Three years ago I decided to try being a real sailor and I took part in a regatta! Real sea, real sailing boat, real feelings!</li>
            <li>I was backpacking through Asia by myself almost for four months.  This experience I will never forget</li>
            <li>Currently I'm learning German. Can't wait to practice my skills with natives!</li>
            <li>I believe in a smile. It is one of the best things as it works wonders. </li>
