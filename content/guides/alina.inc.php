        <h5>Dear friend,</h5>
        <p>
            Five years ago, I had my first tour around Red Square and the city center, with an Australian tourist
            whose mother was Russian.
        </p>
        <p>
            The idea of my tours was simple: Make people feel the local atmosphere, give them the best experience,
            while being relaxed and happy. This is my city, tourists are my guests, and all I want is to be a friend
            for my guests!
        </p>
        <p>
            And today, five years later, my passion still remains the same. Of course, my itineraries are changing,
            ideas are evolving, and I’ve found more friendly and talented people to join the team, which is why I’m
            so excited to welcome you to Friendly Local Guides.
