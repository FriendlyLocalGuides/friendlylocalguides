        <h5>Art Aficionado</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>"Sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast." It's not me who said this but this is something that characterizes me in a single phrase.</li>
            <li>I believe that happiness is a choice as you are as happy as you choose to be. So I choose happiness.</li>
            <li>Oh yes, I am a dreamer.</li>
            <li>I love antiquities and flee markets with old stuff from everywhere.</li>
            <li>I love the present and love to enjoy every single moment of mu life. Well, at least I try to.</li>
            <li>I know that life could be so sweet on a sunny side of the street.</li>
            <li>That doesn't stop me from loving the rain though.</li>
            <li>I do regret that there's no sea in Moscow but I'm so happy there are lots of other cool things to see and to show here.</li>
            <li>Do you love theatre as much as I do? </li>
            <li>There's plenty of both extremely useful and completely useless information about Moscow in my head but what my heart says is: Moscow is a place to be!</li>
