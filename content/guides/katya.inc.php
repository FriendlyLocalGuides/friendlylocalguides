        <h5>Russian Culture Lover</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>I'm interested in everything that is connected with South America and Spanish-speaking countries.</li>
            <li>I can easily do a few things at the same time. Cook, talk on the phone, read an article, book a room in a hotel.</li>
            <li>I travelled 10000 km by motorcycle (being a passenger :))</li>
            <li>Before my big travel to Asia I preferred to eat out than at home. Now I do love cooking at home, and dishes often have this unrepeatable Asian taste.</li>
            <li>Film photography is my passion. Started from my grandpa's Zenit, now I can create and print photos by myself.</li>
            <li>I lived and studied in Granada (Spain). No pasa na'! </li>
            <li>I think running is amazing thing, because it is in our nature and keeps us cheerful and fit.</li>
            <li>Volunteering is something that everyone should try at least once. When I taught English to homeless children in Indonesia, I felt the great feedback and importance of what I am doing.</li>
            <li>I have a blog (currently in Russian only) where I'm writing some new facts that impress me. When the Universe was born, who the Geishas are, and so on :) There are so many amazing things around us, you know!</li>
            <li>I can't meditate in its normal way sitting with closed eyes. Drawing is my best meditation. It can take me far away for hours.</li>
