            <li>I am learning how to make vegetarian sushi. It's going well. </li>
            <li>
                I would like to learn how to make Geogian food and open a Georgian restaurant called "Georgia" in
                the US state of Georgia.
            </li>
            <li>
                I have over ten different names that people call me: AlexANDria, AlexandRIa, Alexandra (people don't
                seem to notice that this is a different name), Alya, Al, Ali, Sasha, Alex (least favorite), Zan,
                Dria, Sashulia, Sashulkina, and other variations.
            </li>
            <li>My dream see all 7 summits.</li>
            <li>I love road trips and walking trips, but trains are my favorite transportation.  </li>
            <li>I often crave spicy food while living in Russia, a non-spicy food country. </li>
            <li>It would be cool to be a performance artist with a focus on acrobatics. </li>
            <li>
                I always hoped I would be reborn an (aerial) dancer, or Ariel (the mermaid). But to be honest, I'd
                rather not be reborn. :)
            </li>
            <li>I've tried living on an all fruit diet. It was interesting but didn't last.</li>
            <li>I'll try anything at least once.</li>
