<!--        <h3>Wine Lover</h3>-->
        <ol>
            <li>I speak German, Italian, English and study French. I just can’t get enough of languages.</li>
            <li>My eyes are of different colors.</li>
            <li>I can sleep standing and with open eyes (thanks, university).</li>
            <li>I love ordinary people’s life stories that teach to be brave and to love. One day I’ll write a book.</li>
            <li>My parents are musicians and although I gave up playing violin and piano sometimes I catch inspiration and play.</li>
            <li>I don’t usually face a choice “tea or coffee?” as I always prefer espresso.</li>
            <li>I highly appreciate everything hand-made and prefer making a present or baking a pie than to buy it in a shop.</li>
            <li>I have a parrot named Murphy.</li>
            <li>My friends are those people with whom I am not afraid to go to the open space.</li>
            <li>I am one of five children, and having a big family has taught me something: almost always it is clear for me whether a person has bros or sisters or grew up as the only child.</li>
