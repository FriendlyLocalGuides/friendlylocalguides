        <h6>Red Square:</h6>
        <p class="intro-txt">Russia and Moscow are synonymous with Red Square and the Kremlin and that’s hardly surprising as you’ll find these places absolutely stunning!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                - Walk-through <strong>the Resurrection Gate </strong>and
                don’t forget to flip a coin so you’ll be sure to come back one day!
            </li>
            <li>
                - Visit the world famous <strong>Kazan Cathedral</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                - See the <strong>State Department Store</strong> (GUM),
                once the Upper Trading Stalls, which were
                built over a century ago and still operating!
            </li>
            <li>
                - Admire the lovely <strong>St. Basil's Cathedral!</strong> The French diplomat Marquis de Custine
                commented that it combined "the scales of a golden fish, the enamelled skin of a serpent,
                the changeful hues of the lizard, the glossy rose and azure of the pigeon's neck" and
                wondered at "the men who go to worship God in this box of confectionery work."
            </li>
            <li>
                - Walk by <strong>Lobnoye Mesto</strong> (literally meaning
                "forehead place", or "Place of the Skulls"),
                once Ivan the Terrible's stage for religious
                ceremonies, speeches, and important events.
            </li>
            <li>
                - Entering the <strong>Alexander Garden</strong>, you’ll take in spectacular views of Russian architecture
                from ancient to Soviet times, as well as the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier with an eternal flame.
                Watch <strong>Changing of the Guard Ceremony</strong> every hour in summer and every half an hour in winter.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Kitai-gorod:</h6>
        <p class="intro-txt">Stroll along medieval <strong>Kitai-gorod</strong> with its strong ancient Russia feel,
            known for its bohemian lifestyle, markets and arts.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                - <strong>Nikolskaya Street.</strong> Here you will find Russia's first
                publishing house, the second oldest monastery, and Ferryn Pharmacy, known as the number one pharmacy back
                in Soviet times and famous for its Empire-style architecture.
            </li>
            <li>
                - <strong>Ilinka Street.</strong> The financial street of the Kitaigorod (China Town)
                district, where you’ll find the Gostiny Dvor (Merchant’s Yard), which is now a showroom for Ferraris and
                Maseratis. The street was designed in the 1790s by Catherine the Great.
            </li>
            <li>
                - <strong>Varvarka street.</strong> The oldest street in Moscow, which
                dates back to the 14th century, and still has remnants of early Muscovite architecture, such as the
                Old English Court and the Palace of the Romanov’s.
            </li>
            <li>
                - <strong>Kamergersky Lane.</strong> Only a small road of about 250
                meters, it is home to some of the oldest artifacts of the city, as each building holds a fascinating
                story. Some of Russia’s most famous writers, poets, and composers from as far back as the Golden Age of
                Russian culture, have lived or worked on this lane.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Historic City Center</h6>
        <p class="intro-txt">

                <h6>The Vernisage</h6>
                <p>
                    at Izmailovo is a large, outdoor shopping market, full of all sorts of Russian souvenirs, crafts, and
                    other interesting things to buy. At this "flea market," you can browse through paintings, rugs from
                    central Asia, and even stop for a bite to eat or drink, where you can taste dishes from different
                    regions of Russia and other former-Soviet nations.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h6>The Kremlin</h6>
                <p>
                    Adjacent to the Vernissage is the Kremlin at Ismailovo. The kremlin, or kreml in Russian, means
                    "fortress," so there are kremlins in many of Russia’s cities, not only the most famous one on Red Square.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our Izmailovo tour is a unique opportunity to be submerged into an atmosphere that resembles the past
                    and to see the masters of handicraft at work, such as blacksmiths, potters, and woodcarvers.
                    If interested, you can even participate in the production itself!

            <li>
                <h6>The Tsars’ palaces</h6>
                <p>
                    at Izmailovo were built based on drafts and engravings from the 16th and 17th centuries.
                    The white stone towers are decorated with colored tiles in accordance with ancient traditions.

                <h6>Souvenirs</h6>
                <p>
                    This flea market is a beautiful spot, brimming with boutique stores and majestic houses.
                    Before returning back, treat yourself to a traditional drink – tea or vodka – with homemade
                    pastry and snacks. Make sure you take a peek in the
                    Chocolate Shop – you simply won’t be able to resist the temptation!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most shops are open only on weekends, until about 5:00pm. Working hours are not always
                    predictable as some stay open longer and others shut down earlier. It is an unforgettable adventure
                    in Izmailovo but you need to catch the magic in time before the shops close.
                </p>

                Exploring Moscow at night is like visiting a whole different city!

                Monuments look greater and more mystical, buildings are aesthetically lit, streets remind us of a grandmother’s
                fairytales, restaurants seem to be cozier, and the people smile and appear to be happier as the night progresses!

                After dark is when Moscow city reallycomes alive, with bars, clubs, strip clubs and late night cafes.

        <div class="intro-txt">
            <p>
                Mother Russia has undergone a lot in its long life. Since time immemorial, Russian rulers have taken
                nearly all political power into their own hands. By the beginning of the XX century, the Russian
                oppositional movement wanted nothing less than the immediate and total destruction of the tsarist
                regime. All of Russia got involved in the bloody revolution of 1917 in an effort to abolish the current
                state of the government and gain freedom for the people.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Our mission on the tour is to find out:</strong></li>
                <li>- How much this 1917 revolution cost the people</li>
                <li>- Whether they actually got the freedom they wanted and was it worth it</li>
                <li>- What happened over the next 74 years</li>
                <li>- Who were the main political leaders of the Soviet Union</li>
                <li>- Were Russians happy and satisfied with Soviet Union?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Our itinerary will lie in most Soviet areas of Moscow, which are quite spread throughout the city, as
                very few of them are left. You can choose how much you are ready to live this Soviet life on a 3, 5,
                or 7 hour tour. Depending on the duration of the tour, you will see part or all of the places below:
            </p>
        </div>

            <li>
                <h6>Red Square</h6>
                <p>
                    Time stands still in Red Square. The Red Square is the heart of Moscow (and whole Russia).
                    Saint Basil's Cathedral will make your mouth drop. If it is from May-October, have a cocktail on
                    the outside terrace and simply people watch! The massive square offers so much to enjoy.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h6>Lenin’s Mausoleum</h6>

            </li>

            <li>
                <h6>Bunker 42</h6>
                <p>
                    Highly recommended <strong>Bunker-42</strong>, <strong>Cold War Museum</strong>, explore the place
                    where Khrushchev lived during the Cuban Crisis. Go down 18 floors to a gigantic bunker under Moscow
                    that was designed to withstand a nuclear attack. Watch a short film about the severity of the
                    Cold War. If you lived through the Cold War, you will hardly believe it is possible that you are
                    in Bunker 42!
